description: Decomposes Specs into robust, independently implementable task files, assigning every test case from _tests.md to exactly one task and enriching tasks from codebase exploration. Use when a spec exists and needs to be broken down into executable tasks, or when task files need enrichment with implementation context. Do not use for spec creation or direct task execution.

# Create Tasks

Decompose requirements into robust, independently implementable task files with codebase-informed enrichment.

## Task Sizing

Every task becomes one full agent run: a fresh context that re-reads the spec corpus, re-explores the codebase, and rebuilds its model of the system from zero before the first edit. That ramp-up is the expensive part of a run — many small tasks pay it over and over and discard the accumulated reasoning at every boundary, while a robust task keeps it working.

- Default to fewer, larger tasks. A task is a complete vertical slice — implementation, wiring, and its assigned tests — delivered end-to-end in one run.
- Split only at real boundaries:
  - **Dependency**: a contract (schema, interface, protocol) must exist before its consumers can build on it.
  - **Parallelization**: two slices touch disjoint files and can run as parallel waves via `_tasks.md` edges.
  - **Domain**: different toolchains or deliverables (backend vs frontend vs SDK vs docs).
- File count is never a split reason: a task spanning 20+ files is healthy when they form one coherent slice, and one agent run handles it comfortably.
- A typical feature lands at 3-7 robust tasks. A breakdown with 10+ tasks almost always contains slices that belong together — merge them before presenting.

## Required Inputs

- Feature name identifying the `.compozy/tasks/<name>/` directory.
- At minimum, `_spec.md` in that directory.
- When present: `_tests.md` (test contract), `_user_stories.md` (story catalog), `_dx.md` (developer-experience contract), and `_uiux.md` (UI change map).

## Workflow

1. Choose the task taxonomy.
   - Prefer the standard work-type slugs: `frontend`, `backend`, `docs`, `test`, `infra`, `refactor`, `chore`, `bugfix`, `qa-report`, and `qa-execution`.
   - When the specification needs a distinct category, define one concise lowercase hyphenated slug in the proposed breakdown and use it consistently. Task `type` is free-form; ordered `loops.defaults.delivery.runtime_rules[].match.type` entries own type-based runtime routing.

2. Load context.
   - Read `_spec.md`, `_user_stories.md`, `_dx.md`, `_uiux.md` (when present), and `_tests.md` from `.compozy/tasks/<name>/`.
   - Read existing ADRs from `.compozy/tasks/<name>/adrs/` to understand the decision context behind requirements and design choices.
   - Resolve every local artifact path or glob cited as a contract, including repo-relative and absolute paths outside the task directory. Read textual contracts and use `eng-ui-screenshot` to render and inspect named visual artifacts; a path mention is an input, not optional background.
   - If `_spec.md` lacks a Technical part (Part II):
     - Warn the user that tasks will be higher-level without implementation guidance.
     - Derive tasks from Part I functional requirements and the `_user_stories.md` catalog instead of Part II implementation sections.
     - During enrichment, rely more heavily on codebase exploration to fill `## Implementation Details`, `### Relevant Files`, and `### Dependent Files`.
     - Mark `<requirements>` with behavior-derived requirements instead of design-derived technical requirements.
     - Explicitly call out missing implementation detail gaps in the task body instead of inventing specifics.
   - If `_spec.md` is missing, stop and ask the user to create it first via `cy-create-spec`.
   - Spawn an Agent tool call to explore the codebase for files to create or modify, test patterns, and coding conventions.

3. Break down into tasks.
   - Apply the Task Sizing doctrine above: slice the spec's Build Order into the smallest number of robust tasks the real boundaries allow.
   - **Each task MUST be independently implementable when all dependencies declared in `_tasks.md` graph edges are met.** No task may require undeclared work from another task. If two tasks share a tight coupling, merge them — or extract the shared piece into a dependency task only when a real boundary separates it.
   - **No circular dependencies.** If task A depends on task B, task B must NOT depend on task A (directly or transitively).
   - Each task must have: title, type, complexity, and dependency relationships in the graph plan.
   - Complexity rates implementation risk, not size — and is never a reason to split:
     - `low`: contained change on well-trodden patterns, low regression risk.
     - `medium`: new interfaces or integration points, moderate coordination.
     - `high`: new subsystem, concurrency, or a broad integration surface.
     - `critical`: cross-cutting change with high regression risk, requires coordination with other tasks.
   - When a task directly implements or is constrained by a specific ADR, include the ADR reference in the task's "Related ADRs" section under Implementation Details.
   - Tests live inside the task that implements the behavior they verify; never create tasks dedicated solely to testing.
   - For every task that implements visible UI from a named visual reference, define an explicit Visual Contract: one row per reference state and required viewport, with the implementation target, fidelity, and source-authorized differences. Never use “all states,” “match the mock,” or “screenshot parity” as a substitute for enumerating rows.
   - Follow the structure defined in `references/task-template.md` and the metadata definitions in `references/task-context-schema.md`.

4. Assign the test contract.
   - Assign every `UT-`, `IT-`, and `E2E-` ID from `_tests.md` to exactly one task — the task that implements the behavior the case verifies. Integration and E2E cases go to the task that completes the flow they exercise.
   - Done when every ID in `_tests.md` appears in exactly one task's planned `## Tests` section: no orphan IDs, no duplicates.
   - If `_tests.md` is missing: warn the user, then write concrete inline cases per task instead — each naming the exact input, condition, and expected result (e.g., "POST /job/done with unknown job ID returns 404"), never a vague "test the happy path".

5. Present the task breakdown for interactive approval.
   - Show every task with: title, type, complexity, a one-line scope summary, dependency chains, and assigned test-ID counts.
   - Wait for user feedback before proceeding; revise and present again until the user explicitly approves.

6. Generate task files.
   - Write `_tasks.md` as the canonical task graph manifest. It MUST start with this YAML frontmatter shape:
     ```markdown
     ---
     schema_version: "compozy.tasks/v2"
     workflow: [feature-name]
     graph:
       nodes:
         - id: task_01
           file: task_01.md
       edges:
         - from: task_01
           to: task_02
     ---

     # [Feature Name] Task List
     ```
   - `_tasks.md` is the only place dependency relationships are stored. Each edge means `from` must finish before `to` can start.
   - Include every task in `graph.nodes`, using canonical sequential ids (`task_01`, `task_02`, ...) and matching files (`task_01.md`, `task_02.md`, ...).
   - Use `edges: []` when there are no dependencies.
   - Write individual task files as `task_01.md` through `task_N.md` (the `task_` prefix has no leading underscore).
   - Each file must start with YAML frontmatter containing only task-owned metadata: `status`, `title`, `type`, and `complexity`. Dependency information lives only in `_tasks.md`.
   - Task numbering must be sequential and consistent between `_tasks.md` and individual files.

7. Enrich each task file.
   - For each task file, check whether it already has `## Overview`, `## Deliverables`, and `## Tests` sections, plus a complete `## Visual Contract` when it implements visible UI from a named reference. Skip enrichment only when every required and conditional section is complete.
   - Map the task to Part I requirements, user stories, Part II guidance, the `_dx.md`/`_uiux.md` surface contracts, and its subset of the `_spec.md` File References index.
   - Spawn an Agent tool call to discover relevant files, dependent files, integration points, and project rules for this specific task.
   - Fill ALL template sections from `references/task-template.md`. Every task file MUST contain each of the following sections — omitting any is a failure:
     - `## Overview`: what slice of the system the task delivers and why, in 2-3 sentences.
     - `<critical>` block: the standard critical reminders block from the template.
     - `<requirements>` block: specific, numbered technical requirements using MUST/SHOULD language.
     - `## Subtasks`: checklist items describing WHAT, not HOW — one per coherent unit of work, typically 5-12 for a robust task.
     - `## Implementation Details`: file paths to create or modify, integration points. Reference `_spec.md` Part II for patterns.
     - `### Relevant Files`: discovered paths from codebase exploration with brief reasons.
     - `### Dependent Files`: files that will be affected by this task with brief reasons.
     - `### Competitor References`: this task's `.resources/<repo>/path` entries copied from `_spec.md` File References — same paths, never paraphrased; omit the subsection when the spec cites none.
     - `### Related ADRs`: links to relevant ADRs if any exist, or omit the subsection if none apply.
     - `## Deliverables`: concrete outputs, including every assigned test case implemented and passing.
     - `## Tests`: the assigned test-case IDs grouped by level with the behavior they cover; full case definitions stay in `_tests.md`.
     - `## Success Criteria`: measurable outcomes including "Every assigned test case implemented and passing".
   - When the task implements visible UI from a named visual reference, also include `## Visual Contract` from the template. Its deliverables and success criteria MUST require the durable `eng-ui-screenshot` evidence bundle for every row; implementation-only captures are invalid evidence.
   - Reassess complexity based on exploration findings and update if changed.
   - Update the task file in place with enriched content.
   - If enrichment fails for one task, continue to the next and report all failures at the end.

8. Audit the resulting task package.
   - Audit the test assignment: every ID in `_tests.md` appears in exactly one task file's `## Tests` section. Fix any orphan or duplicate and re-audit.
   - Audit visual references: every visible UI task that cites one has an explicit Visual Contract row for each required state/viewport, and each row names the durable evidence bundle. Fix vague or missing rows before finishing.

## Error Handling

- If `_spec.md` is missing, stop and ask the user to create it first via `cy-create-spec`.
- If the user rejects the task breakdown, incorporate all feedback before presenting again.
- If codebase exploration reveals task boundaries that do not match the spec, note the discrepancy and ask the user how to proceed.
- If a test case in `_tests.md` fits no task, the breakdown is missing a slice — fix the breakdown rather than dropping the case.
- If the target directory does not exist, create it.
- If a task file already exists and is fully enriched, skip it and move to the next.
- If a named visual reference is missing or cannot be rendered, stop before generating the affected task; do not downgrade it to prose guidance.
